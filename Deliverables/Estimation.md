# 1 Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |  14                           |             
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |   160                         | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 2240|   
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |        224                            |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |   6720 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    Slightly more than 10 days       |
